### Python Basics: Brush up your Python programming
---
Review the files in the following order if you are new to Python: 
1. Python_Basics.py
1. Python_Basics_Loops.py
1. Python_Basics_Dataframes.py
1. PythonGeneratorLambdaMapZip.py
1. PythonAPIDataAnalysis.py

Additionally, I have provided a dummy data source, GroceryData.csv format which you can use for running the codes. Feel free to download it and use it for learning purposes. You will also be using a live API data source (which is Ruby-on-Rails API application) to read JSON data in Python in the PythonAPYDataAnalaysis tutorial.
